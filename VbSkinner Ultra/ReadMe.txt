How The Menu Feature Works !!
-----------------------------

	The menu feature has been the latest addition. so how does it work ? you can build your own menus by using the custom option of the activex control.I have provided a simple menu maker ! currently it does not evaluate your entries . so please be careful while filling it . any way it is re-editable.The menu is then saved on to a file called menu.txt in app.path .Opening which you can see the menu structure. The activex control opens this file and builds a dynamic menu item .so thats it ! now u know how it works ! Please feel free to mail me if you have any comments.

How The Skinner Works !!
------------------------

	The bitmap format of the actual vbskinner provides all the basic images required to build a form. We just have to read the image form particular location and then paint it and that is the logic I have used along with additional options.So enjoy the stuff !!
